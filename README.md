# ASD1C
A collection of C algorythms made for my CS class
<br>Algorythms are written in standard C and take strings with ints in them seperated by single spaces from stdin.<br>
Also there's a test.py script written for algorythm testing. Outputs cool looking chart with results using matplotlib
Comparisons of all algorythms at a scale where they can compete:
