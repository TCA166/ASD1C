# Sorting Algorithms
A collection of C algorithms made for my CS class
<br>Algorithms are written in standard C and take strings with ints in them seperated by single spaces from stdin.<br>
Also there's a test.py script written for algorithm testing. Outputs cool looking chart with results using matplotlib.<br>
Comparisons of all algorithms at a scale where they can compete:
